			<p><b>The Dynaslope Project is a research program developing an early warning system for deep-seated and catastrophic landslides, through landslide sensor technology and community participation in the Philippines</b></p>

			<p><b>Formerly called "DEWS-L" and "DRMS" the Dynaslope Project began in the University of the Philippies Diliman and was funded by the Department of Science and Technology. Today It is implemented by the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology in 50 sites around the Philippines</b></p>

			<p><b>In 2006, after weeks of continuous rain and an earthquake, a catastrophic landslide occured in Brgy. Guinsaugon, St. Bernard, Southern Leyte. The entire village of Guinsaugon was buried, killing over a thousand people, and destroying homes and livelihood.</b></p>
			<br>
			<p><b>The Guinsaugon Tragedy inspired the research beginnings of an early warning system for landslides. From 11 sites, the research expanded to sites in Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao, each with an installed landslide sensor and an organized landslide early warning committee.</b></p>

			<p><b>The early warning system for landslides follows a protocol that derives early warning information from sensor data and surficial ground data.</b></p>
			<p><b>Landslide sensors are a Filipino-made, solar-powered, early warning instrument that is able to detect and monitor ground movement, soil moisture, and is equipped with a rain gauge. Sensors send data to the PHIVOLCS headquarters every 30 minutes, 24 hours-7 days a week.</b></p><br>
			<p><b>The LEWC is composed of members of the community at risk of landslide. They are the projects's partners on-the-ground who participate in learning about the landslide risk, monitoring and warning through measuring observation markers for ground movement, disseminating and communicating early warning information, and response.</b></p>
			<p><b>Each project stakeholder, including PHIVOLCS, the LEWC and the community, and the local government units of the barangay, municpal or city, and province plays an active role in the EWS-L protocol. Early warning information on the current alert level status of the site and the corresponding recommended response is communicated among all stakeholders.</b></p>

			<p><b>Beyond  the development of an early warning system for landslides, the ultimate goal of the Dynaslope Project is sustainability. One of the ways to reach this goal is to ccontinuously build partnerships with the local community and the LGU and by giving them greater roles in the early warning system that they will eventually own.</b></p><br>
			<p><b>Envisioning disaster-resilient communities begins with disaster preparedness. Early warning systems help ensure that the vulnerable are safe even before a disasster strikes. By working together and learning from one another, the Dynaslope project moves forward towards this goal.</b></p>
