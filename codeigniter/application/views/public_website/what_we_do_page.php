<div class="comm-preview-panel description-panel"><p>The community team bridges the Project with its primary stakeholders, maintaining close partnerships with the community and the LGU of the 50 sites. They conduct research on community risk and response, EWS-L framework and infrastructure, and organization development.</p><br><p>CT facilitates trainings and seminars to build capacities of the community, and meets and consults with LGUs, all to forward the effective implementation of a people-centered early warning system for landslides (EWS-L).
</p></div>

<div class="data-preview-panel description-panel"><p>The monitoring team is the primary thrust of the Dynaslope Project in conducting the research and development of threshold and forecasting models for the early warning system of landslides. The team studies and analyzes the current and historical data pool of the project from a multitude of sources to create accurate and data driven threshold models through a peer reviewed scientific process.</p>
<br>
<p>The team also acts as a support to the implementation of the early warning system protocol by developing codes for the automated generation of triggers and alert evaluation. The team also conducts a regular review of the current protocol prior to the formulation and proposition of revisions geared towards an efficient day to day operations and a thoroughgoing early warning system in order for accurate and informative alerts to be disseminated to the community ensuring the safety and awareness of every stakeholder."</p><br><p>The Survey Squad is responsible for the in-depth characterization of the landslide hazard present in the monitoring sites. The team carries out several field surveys in order to map the landslide hazard. Analysis of the landslide features, material, and monitoring data were then conducted to identify the households and other structures at risk to the landslide hazard.</p></div>

<div class="admin-preview-panel description-panel"><p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p><p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

<div class="infra-preview-panel description-panel"><p>TEST leads in the enhancement of sensor performance for an effective early warning system for landslides (EWS-L). TEST manages sensor data from the tilt and soil moisture sensor. By performing experimentations, TEST ensures the quality of the sensor data readings to prevent false alerts. </p><br>
<p>SWAT provides Website automation tools for easier access to the technology developed by the project. The goal of SWAT is to carry out faster dissemination of early warning information for an effective early warning system for landslides (EWS-L).</p></div>
